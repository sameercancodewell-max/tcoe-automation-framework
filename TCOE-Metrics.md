## Daily Log

### Day 1 - December 13, 2025

**Completed:**
- ✅ Java 17 environment setup
- ✅ Gradle project initialization
- ✅ JUnit 5 integration
- ✅ Created Calculator class
- ✅ Wrote 5 unit tests with Allure annotations (@Epic, @Feature, @Story, @Severity)
- ✅ Added @Tag annotations for test filtering (critical, smoke tests)
- ✅ Auto-open test reports configured
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ JaCoCo code coverage integrated (100% Calculator coverage)
- ✅ Allure Reports integrated (enterprise-grade dashboards)
- ✅ Live TV dashboard display configured
- ✅ Python HTTP server running (port 8080) for JaCoCo reports
- ✅ Allure server running (dynamic port) for test reports
- ✅ Network IP configured for TV access (192.168.1.71)

**Tests Created:**
1. testAddNumbers - Basic addition
2. testDeleteNumbers - Basic subtraction
3. testAddNegativeNumbers - Negative number handling
4. testZeroAddition - Edge case with zero
5. testLargeNumbersAddition - Large number handling

**Learnings:**

*Build & Testing:*
- Gradle configuration cache speeds up builds
- JUnit 5 @BeforeEach prevents code duplication
- VS Code Java Language Server needs periodic refresh
- File names must match public class names in Java
- Configuration cache conflicts with some Gradle plugins (use --no-configuration-cache)

*Test Organization & Filtering:*
- Allure annotations (@Epic, @Feature, @Story, @Severity) organize tests by business context
- @Tag annotations enable selective test execution (e.g., run only critical tests before release)
- JUnit @Tag vs Allure @Severity: Tags for execution filtering, Severity for reporting
- Test filtering strategies: `gradle test -Dtags=critical` or create named test tasks

*Reporting & Dashboards:*
- Allure Reports: Industry standard for test visualization (used by FAANG companies)
- Allure serve command required for proper dashboard viewing (HTTP vs file://)
- Allure server port changes on each restart (dynamic port assignment)
- JaCoCo reports auto-update when tests run; Allure requires server restart

*Server Concepts:*
- Any computer can be both client AND server
- Server = program that listens for requests and responds with data
- Port = "apartment number" for services on same IP address (e.g., 8080, 50659)
- Python HTTP server: Simple file server for static content
- Allure server: Specialized server with built-in Jetty for test reporting
- Localhost (127.0.0.1) vs Network IP (192.168.1.71): localhost only accessible on same machine

*TV Display Setup:*
- Network IP needed for cross-device access (not localhost)
- Keep server terminals running for continuous dashboard availability
- F11 for fullscreen, browser tab rotation for multiple dashboards

**Blockers/Issues:**
- None currently

**Next Steps (Day 2):**
- ✅ Add code coverage reporting (JaCoCo) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Configure live TV dashboards - COMPLETED
- ✅ Add 5 more tests to reach 10+ (improve velocity) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Create architecture documentation - COMPLETED
- [ ] Set up Git repository (track code churn)
- [ ] Begin tracking deployment frequency and MTTR

---

### Day 2 - December 14, 2025

**Completed:**
- ✅ Added 5 new tests (total: 10 tests)
- ✅ Implemented multiply and divide methods in Calculator
- ✅ Added exception handling test (divide by zero)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation structure
  - System Architecture with 5 Mermaid diagrams
  - Environment Setup guide (8 steps)
  - Running Tests guide (multiple methods)
  - FAQ (30+ questions answered)
  - Daily Operations runbook
  - Server Management runbook
- ✅ Added breadcrumb navigation to all docs
- ✅ Fixed Java version conflict (Java 11 vs 17)
- ✅ All 10 tests passing (100% pass rate maintained)

**Tests Created Today:**
6. multiplyPositiveNumbers - Multiplication verification
7. multiplyWithZero - Edge case handling
8. dividePositiveNumbers - Division operations
9. divideByZero_ThrowsException - Exception handling validation
10. multiplyNegativeNumbers - Negative number multiplication

**Learnings:**

*Java Environment:*
- Environment variables are session-specific in PowerShell (temporary)
- System variables require administrator privileges to modify
- Oracle Java installer adds javapath to system PATH with high priority
- Use `where.exe java` to find which Java executable is being used
- Variable scope: local variables only exist within their declared method

*Documentation:*
- VS Code markdown preview supports Mermaid diagrams with extension
- Chrome markdown viewers need special Mermaid support extensions
- Playwright-style navigation requires React/Docusaurus framework
- Breadcrumb navigation improves document usability
- Documentation should grow with project complexity

*Test Design:*
- Exception testing uses `assertThrows()` for validation
- Test method names should describe behavior, not implementation
- Edge cases (zero, negatives) are critical for coverage
- Enterprise annotations (Epic/Feature/Story) provide business context

**Blockers/Issues:**
- Java version confusion (resolved with session PATH override)
- Chrome markdown extensions conflicting (resolved by removal)

**Metrics:**
- Tests: 10 (100% increase from Day 1)
- Coverage: 100% (maintained)
- Pass Rate: 100%
- Build Time: ~15s
- Documentation: 6 major files created

**Next Steps (Day 3):**
- [x] Initialize Git repository - COMPLETED
- [x] Create .gitignore file - COMPLETED
- [x] First commit with all current work - COMPLETED
- [x] Push to GitHub - COMPLETED
- [x] Update metrics tracking - COMPLETED
- [ ] Plan Week 2 activities (Git branching, CI/CD)

### Day 2 (Continued) - GitHub Integration

**Additional Completed:**
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Git user configuration (Sameer Chauhan)
- ✅ First commit created (9cbdbb8)
- ✅ GitHub repository created: tcoe-automation-framework
- ✅ Personal access token configured
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub successfully
- ✅ Removed duplicate aClass.java file
- ✅ VS Code test configuration updated
- ✅ Repository now public on GitHub

**GitHub Repository:**
- URL: https://github.com/sameercancodewell-max/tcoe-automation-framework
- Branch: main
- Commits: 1
- Files: 29
- Size: 84.23 KB

**Learnings:**

*Git & Version Control:*
- Git init creates local repository only (not remote)
- GitHub Personal Access Token required for authentication (not password)
- Token can be embedded in remote URL for push: https://TOKEN@github.com/...
- git remote set-url to update remote repository URL
- Important to remove token from config after push for security
- git push -u origin main sets upstream tracking branch

*VS Code Java Extension:*
- Test Explorer requires CodeLens enabled to show Run/Debug links
- Java Language Server workspace needs periodic cleaning
- Full compilation vs incremental compilation affects test detection
- Test discovery can be flaky, Gradle commands more reliable
- .vscode/settings.json controls Java runtime and test configuration

**Next Steps (Week 2 Day 1):**
- [ ] Learn Git branching (feature branches)
- [ ] Practice merge conflicts
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Create pull request workflow
- [ ] Plan GitHub Actions CI/CD

**TV Dashboard URLs:**
- JaCoCo Coverage: `http://192.168.1.71:8080/app/build/reports/jacoco/index.html`
- Allure Reports: `http://192.168.1.71:[dynamic-port]/index.html` (check Allure server output for current port)
